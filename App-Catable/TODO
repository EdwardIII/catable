* Implement a list of recent blog posts.

* Style the "add new post" form better.

* Comments:
    - add nested comments.
    - add reply to comments.

* Add OpenID-based authentication.

* Add support for tagging blog posts with tags (a.k.a "labels" or "keywords").
    - done partially.
    - Add support for more complex queries than just a single tag.
    - Write more extensive tests.

* Add custom authentication (with a login form).

* Add support for WordPress-based themes/styles/skins.
    - May not be feasable because WP themes contain XHTML and PHP code.

* Add preview to comments.


* Implement several blogs in one application.

* Add previews for the posts / comments.

* Implement a base table/class for post and comments.

* Implement JavaScript/AJAX goodness:
    - AJAX previews.
    - LiveJournal-like DHTML replies.

* Add more archive list view types

{{{
<SubStack>	catable should have a "draft" or "hidden" mode
where you can write an article that won't show up in the main page but you can
link to it directly
<SubStack>	so you can link people to drafts of your blog
entries to request comments before posting them for real
}}}

* Add SEO-friendly URLs to posts based on the title instead of just the ID.
like {{ /post/show/my-cat-purred-at-me-today/ }} .
